# Requirements for the project (from Brightspace)

An important part of the Data Visualization course is the semester-long course project. In this project, you will develop an interactive data visualization for a dataset of your own choosing. There are many good reasons for such a practical project running alongside the course – some of which are:
* To understand how the concepts, algorithms, and frameworks from the lecture relate to practical questions and issues of visualization;
* To test-drive your visualization skills in an environment of frequent constructive input and guidance from your peers and the lecturer;
* To apply your visual literacy and critical thinking skills to evaluate your own work;
* To showcase what you’ve learned in this lecture in a tangibe way that goes beyond the mere grade (e.g., as part of a project portfolio for job applications);
* To find out whether data visualization is actually your thing and which aspects of it you like best (graphic design, software engineering, data analytics, visual storytelling / data journalism,...)
* To prepare you for a potential MSc thesis project in visualization.

To wet your appetite for this project and to give you an inspiration for your own project, you can find some of the previous course projects at https://vis-au.github.io/student_projects/ (scroll down to Course Projects).

**Report deadline**: 06-DEC-2024 (end of day) - late submission accepted until 12-DEC-2024 (end of day)

## Guidelines for the report:
* Max. 6 pages total, PDF format only
* Introduction and motivation - ca. 0.5 pages
* Description of the visualization problem (data + task abstraction) - ca.1 page
* Related work/existing solutions if any - ca. 0.5 pages
* Description of the interactive visualization solution (design decisions justified with first principles from lectures) - ca. 1.5 pages
* Example use case showing at least 1 instance of the solution (your visualization) helping with the problem (e.g., supporting the task) - ca.1 page
* Short discussion of limitations - ca. 0.5 pages
* In case of group work: clear description who was responsible for which aspects of the project, and which were taken on jointly - ca. 0.5 pages
* Bibliography - ca. 0.5 pages

Please note that in the same way as for your visualization, also for your report the overall principle of Form-follows-Function applies. This means, you should use the report structure that best fits your report contents and not vice versa! Think about what you need to get across to the censors, so that we can best gauge the efforts you have put into your project, and then adjust the suggested report structure above accordingly! For example, if you spent half the semester to get your visualization on the GPU so that it runs smoothly, you should definitely write about that even if there is no dedicated section on Implementation in the suggested report structure above.

## Guidelines for preparing the video:
* Max. 5 minutes
* Either uploaded as MP4 or put on Youtube/Rumble/Bitchute... (or both)
* In case of the file being too large for handin via Brightspace use Handbrake
* Voice over in English
